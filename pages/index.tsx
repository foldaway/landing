        <Paragraph>
          It all started from the foldaway table in Duncan&apos;s room. Back
          then, on the occasional weekend, we&apos;ll all cram in his room,
          assemble the foldaway table, and start hacking at silly projects that
          are, more often than not, just plain pointless.
          <br />
          <br />
          Pointless yes, but also fun. It&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve
          all gathered at our foldaway table, but its spirit lives on in the
          silly pointless projects we continue hacking on.
